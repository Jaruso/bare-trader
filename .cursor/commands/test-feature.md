## test-feature

Verify a feature using the `trader` CLI; if it fails, fix and merge:
- Use the `trader` system/CLI to validate the feature end‑to‑end.
- If validation fails: create a new branch, diagnose the issue, implement fixes, add/update tests, run tests (fix and re‑run until green), update docs/PLAN if needed.
- Commit with a concise message, push the branch, and open a PR.
