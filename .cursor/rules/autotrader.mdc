# AutoTrader Project Rules

- Always refer to `PLAN.md` for scope and keep it updated with new work.
- Update `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` whenever behavior, config, or workflows change.
- Prefer modular, testable abstractions; avoid silent failures.
- Preserve backward compatibility when touching public CLI or data-loading paths.
- Run tests before finishing changes and report results; mention any warnings.
- Keep data/cache artifacts out of git (only track code under `trader/`).
